            <h2>summer - keshi</h2>
            <p>Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
                If we don't touch lips not an issue
                I don't wanna talk 'bout nobody else
                Know I said no love but I want to
                Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
                If we don't touch lips not an issue
                I don't wanna talk 'bout nobody else
                Know I said no love but I want to
                One time
                Maybe twice in
                One night
                It's alright we're
                Both alone so
                Go together
                Kiss my wounds but
                Not forever
                Fuck around
                Feel my heartbeat
                Fallin' down
                In the backseat
                Fill me up 'cause I'm running on empty
                And it's fine if we're only pretending
                Three months is all we got
                Try not to fall in love
                Don't think I've had enough but I said it's fine by me
                Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
                If we don't touch lips not an issue
                I don't wanna talk 'bout nobody else
                Know I said no love but I want to
                Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
                If we don't touch lips not an issue
                I don't wanna talk 'bout nobody else
                Know I said no love but I want to
                Said we goin' bye bye in a minute
                I'ma chill on the south side, caught feelings
                When the leaves turn, no more favors
                Nice to meet you, catch you later, yeah
                Three months is all we got
                Try not to fall in love
                Said I ain't had enough but I think that's fine by me
                Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
                If we don't touch lips not an issue
                I don't wanna talk 'bout nobody else
                Know I said no love but I want to
                Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
                If we don't touch lips not an issue
                I don't wanna talk 'bout nobody else
                Know I said no love but I want to
                Kiss my wounds but not forever
                Fill me up 'cause I'm running on empty

            <h2>right here - keshi</h2>
            <p>I think some words are overdue
                Could we just do it over?
                Can we just talk it out like friends
                Because I need your shoulder
                I know we ended on the wrong terms
                But I said we're past it
                So why you texting me with questions
                You don't gotta ask me, like
                "I know it's random, how you've been?
                Do you remember 'bout this band you said you listened to?
                When we were younger, when we were softer
                When we were all about each other
                Hope life is treating you better, better, better"
                Girl, what's with that?
                Yo, cut the act
                'Cause I don't got time for laughs
                No, I do not want the past
                But if you are ever in need
                And God has you down on your knees
                And you do not know who to be
                Then go on and come home to me
                Because I'm here
                If you need me I'll be here
                Right here
                Said I'm here
                If you need me, I'll be here
                Right here
                And how you liking this new guy?
                I know you always want the new life
                I hope you taking care of you, like
                The way you cared for me in my time
                See you got yourself some new friends
                No, you don't need to go to Houston
                You got me thinking back about then
                Girl, I wonder why you texting
                Girl, what's with that?
                Yo, cut the act
                'Cause I don't got time for laughs
                No, I do not want the past
                But if you are ever in need
                And God has you down on your knees
                And you do not know who to be
                Then go on and come home to me
                Because I'm here
                If you need me, I'll be here
                Right here
                Said I'm here
                If you need me, I'll be here
                Right here
